# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
The purpose of this project was to create a binary classifier, using a neural network, to attempt to predict whether applicant to a charity organization, Alphabet Soup, will be successful with their funding. The starting dataset consisted of a CSV of over 34,000 organizations that received funding from Alphabet Soup. The columns in the dataset included:
* EIN and NAME — Identification columns
* APPLICATION_TYPE — Alphabet Soup application type
* AFFILIATION — Affiliated sector of industry
* CLASSIFICATION — Government organization classification
* USE_CASE — Use case for funding
* ORGANIZATION — Organization type
* STATUS — Active status
* INCOME_AMT — Income classification
* SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS — Special consideration for application
* ASK_AMT — Funding amount requested
* IS_SUCCESSFUL — Was the money used effectively

The goal was to attempt to develop a model with over 75% accuracy in predicting success from the given data.

## Result 
even though i had memory problem i was able to get the results.

## Summary
Neural networks are complex machines. There are lots of moving part to keep track of.
in the first attempt The ‘EIN’ and ‘NAME’ columns are removed.
